Woohoo! It's working!

By the way, here's the text message I'll send to people who try to call you from now on:

Thanks for not leaving a voicemail! Here's how you can contact {{ mailbox.name }}:

Text message:
{{ mailbox.phone_number|national_format }}

Email:
{{ mailbox.email }}

If you still need to leave a voicemail, this phone number goes straight to {{ mailbox.name }}'s voicemail:
{{ voicemail_number|national_format }}
