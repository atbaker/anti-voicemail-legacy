Congratulations! I'm all set to start taking your voicemails üòÅ

By the way, I made this just for you. It's no ordinary GIF - if you ever need to set up Anti-Voicemail‚Ñ¢ again, you can text me this file and I'll remember all your answers to my questions. That makes this GIF downright magical ‚ú®

Now get on with your life!
