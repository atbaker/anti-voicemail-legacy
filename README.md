# anti-voicemail
A voicemail app for people who really, really don't like receiving voicemails

## To-do

- Get calling Twilio number directly to work (need some persistence that remembers who called before)
- Investigate ForwardedFrom capability
- Write tests
- Model for Mailbox stored locally in SQLite
- SMS-based setup workflow
- QR code SQLite dump
- Maybe restructure views.py
